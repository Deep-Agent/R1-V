The problem states "Water in Bottlers" and it further specifies "Bottles." This suggests the water used for the analysis comes directly from the Bottles themselves. Hence, "Bottles" could be interpreted as "Bottled water" if the Bottles refer to the water reservoirs in a bottling plant. This water is then further specified as coming from Softener used in Bottlers During Campaign, implying the bottling process uses a softener before bottling the water. The softener likely results in water that is purified and is free from minerals and other substances that could affect the quality of the water for consumption purposes. Thus, the kind of water used for analysis is Bottled Water.

I need to identify the function of "T" in the schedule, which seems to depict a specific type of session. Looking at the table structure, "T" is associated with several columns and rows. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. The table includes several columns, such as date, session name, and time.
2. The rows include descriptions like "Scientific Session," "Chair," and "Participants."
3. Some cells also include "P" and "E," which might be part of the table's structure, not necessarily attached to "T."
4. The "T" is seen in various sections like "Coffee/Tea," "Exhibition," "Sponsor," and "Chair," suggesting it could mean "Topic" or "Topic of discussion."
5. Upon reflection, "T" seems to be mostly present in "Scientific Session" and "Presentation" types.

Therefore, "T" in the context of this table likely indicates a type of scientific or technical session being held simultaneously during breaks.

Final answer: <answer>2</answer>
<think>
The second option (Presentation) fits contextually given the general nature of sessions in the table, focusing on scientific discussions under various headings.

To find the age by color for the under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific data for under 21 years old from the provided tables.
2. Convert the age ranges into non-white percentages since the text mentions race.
3. Combine these percentages to get the final number.

Step 1 & 2:
- The text references Table 6-4 for the under 21 year population.
- It states that the total age by color for this group is 389,536.
- The text further mentions that 11,012 of this population is non-white.

Step 3:
- To calculate non-white percentages, divide non-white numbers by total:
  Non-white percentages for each class:

  White: 49.4%
  Non-white: 50.6%

- Total non-white population for this age group = 11,012 * 50.6%

- This equals approximately 5,560 non-whites in total for under 21 years old.
</think>

There seems to be a discrepancy in the information provided. The number 5,560 does not match any data presented in the given tables. The percentage calculations seem to be incorrect or the actual number is not fully provided.

Let's analyze the table to determine the meaning of "T":

1. First, we'll check the first row, which seems to be for headers or titles of sections, as it's a combination of a number and an abbreviation.
2. The main column shows dates and times, followed by names.
3. The second column is titled "REGISTRATION," suggesting a registration area or lineup.
4. A small letter "T" appears beside the heading "P.".
5. Since "T" is located after the registration heading and is part of the same section as the registration, it most likely represents a registration area or group.
6. We see a "Scientific Section T" under the time and date, which also includes "T", indicating related activities.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that "T" refers specifically to the registration area or group T.

Specifically, it shows that in the Unemp. column, the total population under 21 years of age is 3,950, and the total number of those in the labor force is 3,392. However, the table does not directly provide statistics for Whites and Nonwhites (either all classes combined or separately) under 21 years of age in 1950. The data may not be available in a way that compares these populations across all classes distinctly.

Before providing the answer, let's examine the document carefully for the information related to "newly diagnosed". The document contains various medical and research-related details, but not all in a clear, concise manner. We need to focus on any part of the text that could imply a count of new diagnoses. 

The text mentions a "Lipid Population", likely referring to patients with lipids or related conditions. Among the "Population" details, there is a note that reads "Most common treatment 1.0MMa Gr/2," which does not immediately hint at new diagnoses.

However, the "Comments" section does mention "Number of newly diagnosed". This suggests there is an answer available beneath the "Comments" section.

Let's check the "Comments" section:
1. The document concludes with the phrase: "Comments:"
2. Under this, it lists "Lipoprotein, Lipid" which likely means it is the subject matter or research focused on in this project.

So, the "Number of newly diagnosed" section is likely below the Comments section, which has "Lipoprotein, Lipid" as its topic.

Now, the logical step is to look for the number immediately after "Lipoprotein, Lipid" in any section below the Comments.

However, there is no explicitly stated value given directly in the text of the form. It is also worth noting that other fields like site specifics also have numeric values such as 3000 and 4500, so it's likely that the number of newly diagnosed is related to these values.

The remainder of the letter discusses a personal aspect of Jack Eastman's plans, involving a trip to Europe and visiting family at his own expense. The main topic of the letter, however, pertains to justifying the costs associated with these travel plans.

The term "Travel Expense Justification" suggests that the purpose of the letter is to provide reasons or documents that would support Eastman's financial request or justification for covering some of the travel expenses, possibly up to a maximum amount denoted as 'L3/20'. This implies a financial aspect to the content of the letter.

Therefore, the primary focus and subject of this letter can be deduced from the phrase "Travel Expense Justification."

The invoice has several lines with amounts. To find the total amount, we need to add up the individual amounts:
For line 5144: Individual service invochations, design fees, it lists $45.00.
Next, for line 5144: Kansas promotion, goodfirms opening, layouts, it has $13.00.
Then, for line 5144: Cornell - layout & development, it has $56.00.
Lastly, it states the invoice total amount.
To calculate the total, we add these amounts: $45.00 + $13.00 + $56.00 + $94.00 (the invoice total amount).

The document shows a date in the "Date" field, which is likely an "Effective Date" or relevant event date. As this is a sweepstakes announcement, it would typically be the date the winners are named or the deadline for entries, which is usually a recent weekend. Given that there's a reference to the "Winston 500 weekend" and "October," the most plausible effective date is October 10, 1998. It aligns with the timeline of the Winnitot X race and the typical scheduling for weekend events in auto racing.

To determine the subject of this letter, I will break down the key elements mentioned:

1. The letter is from a company company.
2. It relates to travel and expense.
3. It involves some contact with European factories.

These details suggest that the letter is about travel, potentially for the employee Jack Eastman to visit European factories for business purposes. The company is likely providing information or guidelines on how to handle travel expenses related to this travel.

The overall context points to the need to manage travel expenses and possibly justify this expense to secure company approval.

The document does not provide an explicit date. However, based on the nature of the document which appears to be part of a Sweepstakes announcement, it seems likely that the date of the announcement would be relatively recent. Given the modern format suggested (October 10-11), assuming this document was made available for a weekend event in October, the most recent announcement date would be a few weeks or months prior to when this document was created. As we do not have a more precise dating element, we cannot determine the exact date.

The advertisement starts with an announcement that Jeff Gordin's 5/8 victory in the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway marked the first week a Winston 500 could be run. It also notes that if one lucky fan wins in any Winston No Bull race and wins the next Winston No Bull 5 in a row, they win the Winston 500.

  - Applying: $6,317.56
  - Others: $8,225.00
* We then sum these amounts:
  - Applying's amount: $6,317.56
  - Others' amount: $8,225.00

The Grand Total is the final total amount shown on the last line of the budget breakdown by source. According to the table:
1. The last two columns show the subtotal and grand total.
2. The grand total column is at the bottom of the table.
3. The value in the grand total column should reflect the sum of all other funds.
Examining the table:
- Source of Funding, personnel: Total = $ 1,250
- Source of Funding, equipment: Total = $ 2,850
- Source of Funding, supplies: Total = $ 3,125
- Source of Funding, mailing costs: $ 300
- Source of Funding, travel: $ 400
- Source of Funding, other expenses: $ 1,000
- Other sources: Total = $ 5,133.50

To calculate the Grand Total, Sum of the subtotals:

1. Add the subtotals of the Source of Funding section: $1,250 + $2,850 + $3,125 + $300 + $400 + $1,000 = $ 8,725
2. Add the Other sources section: This is $5,133.50 as shown in the table.

The Grand Total is therefore $ 8,725 + $5,133.50 = $ 13,858.50.

   - 5:00 p.m. - Arrive at Garden Plaza Hotel, Johnson City. This doesn't specify dress code.
   - 7:20 p.m. - Meet in hotel lounge for dinner departure. This might suggest a more formal occasion, but it's too brief to definitively state a dress code.

5. We need to focus on the evening departure, which is directly related to the dinner event.

Given this analysis, the most relevant information is incomplete. The original text does not provide a dress code for dinner departure, leaving us with insufficient details to definitively answer the question.

Therefore, I must conclude my answer based on the available information.

A spring application of fumigants is highly effective under certain conditions. The key factors include the presence of nematodes or nematode-infested soil, suitable soil moisture levels at the time of treatment, effective application technique, and favorable weather conditions. The application timing in March and April, before peak infestations, allows for effective control of soil-borne pathogens such as nematodes and their control methods is critical given their role in soil and plant health or in economic losses from nematode outbreaks.

Nematodes and insecticides are widely used for control in fields and are essential in agriculture, though they might be overlooked initially compared to herbicides.
</think>
<answer>
2. Apply soil incorporation or other 2 to 3 inch soil depth. Cover soil after application and seal completely.
3. Fumigation generally produces best control. Fumigant efficacy is reduced with temperatures greater than 70 degrees.
4. Post treatment for 3-5 days before weather conditions are favorable. The soil temperature should be 50 degrees or higher.
2. Soil temperature should be 50 degrees or higher at 6 inches depth. For optimum nematode control in a moist soil, apply when the soil surface temperature is at or above 60 degrees F, with minimum air temperatures during the day of 37 degrees F. This allows for good nematode survival in soil in low temperatures.
2. Apply 12.4 ounces of MobiGard 2X at a rate of 45 gallons per acre. Apply after soil incorporation.
1. Apply using a tractor power sprayer, with full field penetration and penetration rate of over 3 gallons per minute.

The question asks for the RJR Brand mentioned on the form. Let's examine the document to find this information. The text appears to start with a space, but considering that, it's likely referring to a subsequent line or phrase within the document itself.

On the first clear legible line and following that up, the document provides a structured question, prompting for the RJR Brand. The question starts with "R. J. R. Brand:", which typically denotes the brand name in such documents. This brand name is the key we're aiming to identify.

Looking through the provided textual content, we can see that the mention of "Eclipse" fits contextually as it aligns with the typical branding for retail mail products. The first occurrence of "Eclipse" after the space and immediately preceding "R. J. R. Brand" likely refers to the RJR brand in this form.

Therefore, if we follow that logic, the RJR Brand mentioned is likely "Eclipse". This aligns strictly with what is typically seen in media documentation, where a brand name is typically followed by such a description like "Eclipse" on its own line, making it a clear indicator to differentiate from other information.

Step 2: Identify the key information relevant to spring applications: application timing, application surface, and product type.
Step 3: Analyze the information to determine which conditions make spring fumigant applications most effective.
Step 4: Determine the number of effective conditions based on the information given.

<answer>2</answer>

<think>
We are looking for conditions under which spring fumigant applications are effective based on the provided information. The text mentions several methods for effectively using nematode and insecticidal fumigants. These methods include:
1. Application in soil incorporation or place it 7 to 9 inches deep.
2. Application in wet, heavy or sandy soils.
3. Application after harvest or after irrigation, accompanied with spring treases, prior to planting, dry weather during spring, or with an irrigation.
4. Applying the product on wet seed beds or immediately after the application.

These conditions are all mentioned as beneficial for effective fumigant applications. The number of effective conditions under which spring fumigant applications are effective is 2.

Poster A4: Title: Efficiency of implementing combined regimen of long-acting and low-dose injectable antimalarials (LDA) against chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in an integrated community-based malaria surveillance (CPSM) initiative within the National Malaria Control Strategy of Kenya. 

To determine the target publication date/journal for the poster A4, consider the following steps:
1. The title and scope of the poster indicates that it focuses on implementing combined regimens of long-acting and low-dose injectable antimalarials (LDA) for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria within a community-based malaria surveillance initiative in Kenya.

The study number is 945-955-262. It's a clinical study listed under the "Medical Abnormalities: Orthopedics" category. The source provides a URL for references and notes that the investigator is Lead Investigator. Additionally, it's mentioned that a Medical Abnormalities of the Nervous System with Neurological Impairment and Motor Difficulty. This matches with clinical studies focusing on orthopedics and neurological issues, where the term "motor difficulties" aligns with issues related to arthritis or other bone and musculoskeletal conditions.

Since the study has a focus on orthopedic conditions, such studies often originate from countries where orthopedic facilities are well-established, likely within Europe where a high percentage of medical studies originate from.

Additionally, the study was conducted in Brazil, indicated by part of the reference "EMBRAPA" in the study numbers. This suggests that the study could have been conducted with significant involvement from Brazilian researchers or institutions. However, for the exact nation where this study is performed, Brazil seems a likely answer.

Furthermore, studies in Brazilian orthopedics facilities align with the focus of studying medical abnormalities in a regionally significant field. Thus, while further research is needed for an overall definitive answer, Brazil is a key region likely involved in such studies.

ISIN stands for International Securities Index Number. Initially, the concept of ISINs originated from the idea of providing unique serial numbers for financial instruments to ensure easy identification and verification across markets. As financial markets became increasingly globalized, the requirement for internationally recognized identifiers for securities instruments grew. International Securities Index Number (ISINs) were developed to fulfill this need by offering an unambiguous code for bonds, equities, ETFs, unit trusts, and other financial instruments. The full form of ISIN is the International Securities Index Number, aiming to simplify the process of identifying and managing financial instrument codes on a global scale to enhance transparency, efficiency, and ease of use in securities trading and investment management.

The slicing standard is given for each breed, excluding Mitchell who is listed as 2100 tons, which is not a slicing standard.

This information can be extracted by finding the relevant section or data row in the given table. The key to locating this information is identifying headers that correspond to the part's designation and its status after operations such as cutting. Usually, titles or column names are clear indicators. Looking at the table, it's not immediately clear which 'Test Part' directly relates to 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER.' To find this accurately, one should refer to the 'Test Part' column headers carefully since they typically provide context or designations for test parts under various operations.

The header 'Test Part' at the column title level should guide directly to the corresponding data row within the table. If the table layout is such that it shows each test part for different operations beneath the overall 'Test Part' header, then the specific 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER' information would be in the row directly corresponding to that designation.

The approach to finding the exact test part value for 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER' can be summarized as:
1. Checking the 'Test Part' header title for clues to identify the correct row.
2. Scanning through the rows within the 'Test Part' header row to identify the specific test part designations.
3. Verifying the row data to find the specific reference to 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER' under the context of the test part list.

Assuming that 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER' in this context refers to a test part that is part of a larger process involving various operations like cutting and perhaps drying, the test part number that matches 'PART AE AFTER CUTTER' could be inferred from its positioning within a designated group for such parts.

The key details from the information are:
1. The jury awarded punitive damages in favor of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
2. It was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco.
3. The award was in the amount of $2 million.
4. Robert R. Jones is identified as the plaintiff in the case.
Based on these details, we need to deduce who has been awarded punitive damages, which implies the person must be the plaintiff himself or someone directly affected by the case in a similar matter.

The name Robert R. Jones is mentioned, and it is noted that the plaintiff Robert R. Jones is the widower of Suzanne Jones. This suggests that Mr. Jones' claim and damages are not separate from those of Mrs. Jones, which implies that Robert R. Jones is indeed the widow of Suzanne Jones.

Therefore, Robert R. Jones, the widower of Suzanne Jones, is the person awarded the punitive damages.

Since the list of organizations is extensive and the focus is on mentions of key organizations, we do not have enough information to directly list the address. Therefore, based on the given image, we could not provide a direct answer to the question.

The problem states "Water in Bottlers" and it further specifies "Bottles." This suggests the water used for the analysis comes directly from the Bottles themselves. Hence, "Bottles" could be interpreted as "Bottled water" if the Bottles refer to the water reservoirs in a bottling plant. This water is then further specified as coming from Softener used in Bottlers During Campaign, implying the bottling process uses a softener before bottling the water. The softener likely results in water that is purified and is free from minerals and other substances that could affect the quality of the water for consumption purposes. Thus, the kind of water used for analysis is Bottled Water.

I need to identify the function of "T" in the schedule, which seems to depict a specific type of session. Looking at the table structure, "T" is associated with several columns and rows. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. The table includes several columns, such as date, session name, and time.
2. The rows include descriptions like "Scientific Session," "Chair," and "Participants."
3. Some cells also include "P" and "E," which might be part of the table's structure, not necessarily attached to "T."
4. The "T" is seen in various sections like "Coffee/Tea," "Exhibition," "Sponsor," and "Chair," suggesting it could mean "Topic" or "Topic of discussion."
5. Upon reflection, "T" seems to be mostly present in "Scientific Session" and "Presentation" types.

Therefore, "T" in the context of this table likely indicates a type of scientific or technical session being held simultaneously during breaks.

Final answer: <answer>2</answer>
<think>
The second option (Presentation) fits contextually given the general nature of sessions in the table, focusing on scientific discussions under various headings.

Let's analyze the table to determine the meaning of "T":

1. First, we'll check the first row, which seems to be for headers or titles of sections, as it's a combination of a number and an abbreviation.
2. The main column shows dates and times, followed by names.
3. The second column is titled "REGISTRATION," suggesting a registration area or lineup.
4. A small letter "T" appears beside the heading "P.".
5. Since "T" is located after the registration heading and is part of the same section as the registration, it most likely represents a registration area or group.
6. We see a "Scientific Section T" under the time and date, which also includes "T", indicating related activities.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that "T" refers specifically to the registration area or group T.

To find the age by color for the under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific data for under 21 years old from the provided tables.
2. Convert the age ranges into non-white percentages since the text mentions race.
3. Combine these percentages to get the final number.

Step 1 & 2:
- The text references Table 6-4 for the under 21 year population.
- It states that the total age by color for this group is 389,536.
- The text further mentions that 11,012 of this population is non-white.

Step 3:
- To calculate non-white percentages, divide non-white numbers by total:
  Non-white percentages for each class:

  White: 49.4%
  Non-white: 50.6%

- Total non-white population for this age group = 11,012 * 50.6%

- This equals approximately 5,560 non-whites in total for under 21 years old.
</think>

There seems to be a discrepancy in the information provided. The number 5,560 does not match any data presented in the given tables. The percentage calculations seem to be incorrect or the actual number is not fully provided.

The relevant data for under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950 is provided in Table A-2. Specifically, it shows that in the Unemp. column, the total population under 21 years of age is 3,950, and the total number of those in the labor force is 3,392. However, the table does not directly provide statistics for Whites and Nonwhites (either all classes combined or separately) under 21 years of age in 1950. The data may not be available in a way that compares these populations across all classes distinctly. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the exact numbers for Whites and Nonwhites specifically from this table, only the total counts.
</think>
<answer>
These data do not provide separate counts for white and nonwhite people under 21 years of age within the given table. Thus, it's not possible to answer the question accurately with the given data.
