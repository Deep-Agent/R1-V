Content: To determine what "T" depicts in the table, let's follow the analytical process step by step:

1. The table is a general program for the CORESTA Congress in 1998.
2. The table is divided by different days (Sunday to Thursday) and specific times throughout the day.
3. Each cell in the table represents a specific session or event.
4. The categories listed at the bottom of the table are:
   - A - Agronomy Group
   - S - Smoke Group
   - P - Phytopathology Group
   - T - Technology Group
5. "T" is listed at the bottom of the table alongside "Technology Group".

Given that "T" directly corresponds to "Technology Group", we can deduce that "T" is an abbreviation for "Technology".

1. The table is a schedule for the 1998 CORESTA Congress General Programme.
2. The first column lists days of the week, from Sunday to Thursday.
3. The second column outlines the activities for each day, with specific times and descriptions.
4. The third column has categories labeled with letters (A, P, S, T, A, etc.).
5. The categories are further broken down into specific subcategories, such as "S - Smoke Group," "P - Phytopathology Group," etc.
6. The "T" appears under the Wednesday (Wednesday 14 October) and Thursday (Thursday 15 October) rows, next to various activities.

Given that "T" is consistently paired with other letters that correspond to specific groups, such as "A" (Agronomy Group) and "P" (Phytopathology Group), it is logical to infer that "T" represents a specific group as well.

The context provided with the table includes the possible meanings for each group, such as "T - Technology Group." This suggests that "T" stands for "Technology Group."

2. **Analyze the Headers**: The table is divided into columns with different letters (A, P, S, T). These letters likely categorize the sessions or activities.

3. **Look for Patterns and Definitions**: The letters are accompanied by brief descriptions. "A" is associated with "Agronomy Group," "P" with "Phytopathology Group," and "S" with "Smoke Group." There is no explicit description for "T," but we need to infer its meaning based on the surrounding context.

4. **Examine the Content**: "T" is associated with "Technology Group." This suggests that the "T" column likely contains sessions or activities related to technology.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the absence of a definitive description for "T," we can infer that "T" stands for "Technology."

To determine the amount of cents mentioned in the image, let's break it down step by step:

1. The image appears to be a check issued by the United States Treasury.
2. There is a section labeled "DOLLARS" which indicates the amount in dollars.
3. There is no explicit amount for cents given on the check.
4. The amount mentioned in the "DOLLARS" section is "551".

Since the check does not provide a separate amount for cents, the amount mentioned in cents must be combined with the amount in dollars. The "DOLLARS" section indicates "551", which suggests that the amount is 551 dollars and 0 cents.

Therefore, the final answer is 0 cents.

The document is a budget application form for a project with various expense categories listed. The "Other Expenses" category is broken down into two main items: printing and publication expenses. 

1. Manuals: The budget estimates 500 manuals, with a subtotal of $1,000.
2. Summary: The budget estimates 500 summaries, with a subtotal of $500.

The question asks for the total "Subtotal for Other Expenses," which in this context would be the sum of these two subtotals.

500 manuals * $500 = $250,000
Summaries: 500 * $250,000 = $125,000

Subtotals: $250,000 + $125,000 = $375,000
