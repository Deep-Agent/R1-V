Content: We need to determine the total number of large objects in the image.

1. Look for the large objects on the left side of the image.
2. Determine if the large object is metal or rubber.

Let's analyze the image step by step:

- **Large ball on the left side**: This is metal.
- **Large cyan cylinder**: This is rubber.
  - Total large objects = 2

Therefore, the total number of large objects in the image is:

  We need to determine the material (rubber, metal, or tiny) of each object in the image.
  - The red sphere is likely metal.
  - The small rubber block on the right seems to be rubber.
  - The gray cube on the right is likely rubber due to its appearance.
  - The yellow block is likely rubber due to its appearance.
  - The cyan rubber cylinder and the tiny brown block are likely rubber as well.

To determine the number of geometrical objects among the items, we need to count the cubes and cylinders. A cube is a 3D shape with six square or rectangular faces, while a cylinder is a 2D shape with circular bases that roll up and down vertically. Based on the geometric shapes in the image:

- There is 1 large cube and 2 small cubes (in the shape of cubes).
- There is 1 large cylinder with a circular base.
- There is 1 small cylinder with a circular base.
- There is 1 cube with a square base.

Adding these together: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 geometric objects.

Therefore, the total number of geometrical objects is 4.

To answer questions about the arrangement of objects, we first need to identify all the objects present in the image whose tags correspond to a material (such as metal or rubber). We can classify each object based on the tags that are visible.

1. Red shiny object: Metallic objects often have a tag that indicates they are metallic or shiny.
2. Green shiny objects: Again, those would have tags corresponding to shiny surfaces.
3. Yellow shiny objects: Metallic objects with a yellow color.
4. Green rubber object: This could belong to either the rubber or the green shiny categories based on visual description.
5. Red matte surface: Not a metallic object.

<answer>5</answer>

The image contains 5 large objects (green metal and green shiny) and 2 matte objects (green cylinder and red matte).
