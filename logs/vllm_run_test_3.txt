To determine the number of West Dodge Road, let's analyze the information provided in the label image:

2. The address is given as "8401 West Dodge Road."

From this information, we can deduce that:
- The number of West Dodge Road is 8401.
- The number of Suite is not explicitly given in the label. However, since the address is stated with "Suitede 156," it is likely that the suite number is located as a part of the address, not specifically named in the image.

To determine the number of West Dodge Road, we need to analyze the information provided on the file card:

1. The file is titled "Swanson."
2. The name on the file card is Arnold E. Schaefer, PhD. (Executive Director of Swanson Center for Nutrition.)
3. The address is given as Suite 156, 8401 West Dodge Road, Omaha, Nebraska 68114.

From the information given, we can see that the address is given in a specific block of text, which is formatted in a way that suggests it is part of a structured format. However, without additional context or specific formatting, it is difficult to directly extract the numerical part of the address. 

However, we can use a rough approximation or estimate based on the provided text that may give an idea of the number. The text mentions suite number "156" which might suggest additional context or specific location within the building (e.g., lower or upper floors). Given the usual numbering practices in such environments, the suite number might be somewhere around 3-10 which can be considered an approximation within this form of organization.

To provide a specific numerical approximation, the text does not provide a precise number for West Dodge Road. Therefore, we cannot accurately determine the numeric value attached to the number 8401.

There is no mention of the number 84 in the provided address or the information about the address. Therefore, the exact number of West Dodge Road cannot be confirmed with the given label details.

To calculate the percentage of TZD share in 2000, you need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of TZD shares in 2000.
2. Divide the number of TZD shares by the total number of TZD (5 units) to get the percentage.

Let's do these calculations:
1. Number of TZD shares in 2000: 10,577
2. Total number of TZD: 50,000

Percentage of TZD share in 2000:
(People in category) / (Total number of people) * 100%

So,

  To order straw hats for company personnel, you would need to determine the appropriate type for these responsibilities.
  Straw hats are typically used for outdoor activities in warm weather.
  Therefore, the most appropriate type for company personnel would likely be a type that can be easily washed and used for outdoor events, such as a straw hat made of lightweight, breathable fabric.
  However, the list does not specify the exact type of straw hat, so additional research would be needed to confirm the best choice.

Let's break down the information provided in the image step by step to find the number of newly diagnosed:

1. **Number of patients in practice**: 300
2. **Most common treatment**: 10
3. **Number of newly diagnosed**: 10

To find the number of newly diagnosed, we need to multiply the number of patients in practice by the most common treatment:
\[ \text{Number of newly diagnosed} = 300 \times 10 = 3000 \]

So, the number of newly diagnosed is:

The task at hand is to count the number of newly diagnosed patients in 2021.

The source link provided indicates that 3000 - 4000 is the most common treatment for lipid population.
The source link also indicates that 10% of patients need a new treatment.
Thus, the number of newly diagnosed patients could be 50% of 3000.
50% of 3000 is approximately 1500.

Therefore, the number of newly diagnosed patients is 1500.

<thinking> To determine the page number at the bottom of the page, let's analyze the document step by step:

1. Identify the last line of the text on the page.
2. Check for a number or a page break sign.

The last line of the text states "Professor Ivar Werner, MD" followed by the word "Department of Geriatrics, University of Uppsala".

However, there is a page break sign before "Department of Geriatrics, University of Uppsala," making it impossible to read the entire last line as a number. Therefore, we cannot determine the page number at the bottom of the page from the last line of the text.

Based on the analysis, there is no digitized page number visible or provided that can be confirmed on the original document.

The last line of the text with a visible number likely provides the number:
