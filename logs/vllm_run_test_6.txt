I need to identify the function of "T" in the schedule, which seems to depict a specific type of session. Looking at the table structure, "T" is associated with several columns and rows. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. The table includes several columns, such as date, session name, and time.
2. The rows include descriptions like "Scientific Session," "Chair," and "Participants."
3. Some cells also include "P" and "E" after "P-," which might depict the type of talk or presentation format (perhaps "P" could stand for "Presentation" or some other terminology).
4. The row with "T" is not directly labeled, but it follows a structured format and seems to be part of different sections.

Given the typical structure format in most scientific conference schedules, the letter "T" is likely used to indicate a workshop, roundtable discussion, or any type of interactive session. These sessions typically involve all attendees and focus on discussions and debates rather than formal lectures.

In conclusion, a letter "T" in such tables most likely represents a "Roundtable discussion." Given the given options, the correct answer is 5, as these types of sessions often come after a main lecture or presentation and focus on panel discussions or group activities.

Let's analyze the table to determine the meaning of "T":

1. First, we'll check the first row, which seems to be for headers or titles of sections, as it's a combination of a number and an abbreviation.
2. The main column shows dates and times, followed by names.
3. The second column is titled "REGISTRATION," suggesting a registration area or lineup.
4. A small letter "T" appears beside the heading "P.".
5. Since "T" is located after the registration heading and is followed by "SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS," it most likely represents a session or type in a scientific context.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that "T" probably stands for "Technological," which makes the most sense in the context of scientific sessions.

Therefore, "T" in this context likely corresponds to "Technological."

The problem requires determining the "Age by Color" for St. Louis County, 1950 for the 'under 21 years of age' category across all classes. The data is provided in the table, where the 'All Ages' of 389,536 represents the total population for ages both under and 21 years old, and 139,137 and 250,399 represent the population under 21 years of age for the total population and all races, respectively.

To break this down:
1. The 'All ages' category includes individuals of all ages, from birth onwards.
2. The under 21 years of age are counted separately, as indicated by the values for 'All ages' of 389,536 and the breakdown for under 21, which is 139,137. However, our interest is specifically in the under 21 category.

Looking at the 'All ages' total of 389,536 and knowing the unadjusted under 21 age count is 139,137, assuming there are no significant demographic shifts to adjust for, these numbers are fairly reliable for this age category.

Therefore, the number of under 21 years old for all classes combined (both White/Black and all races) in St. Louis County, 1950, is 139,137.

To find the age by color for the under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific data for under 21 years of age
2. Locate the 'All Classes' category
3. Compare this data to the 'All Ages' category to see if under 21 years of age data is included within it

After inspecting the data, I see that the under 21 years of age category is indeed included under 'All Ages'. The data provided for 'All Ages' is:

- White: 139,137
- Non-White: 137,013

These numbers directly represent the number of individuals under 21 years of age in St. Louis County, 1950 for all classes combined.

I need to verify if there is a corresponding data point specifically for 'All Classes', but there doesn't appear to be a distinct category for ages 0 to 21, so 'All Ages' likely encompasses all classes within this age range.

Given that the data for both 'All Ages' under 21 years, and non-white under 21 years, are provided and are in addition to the under 21 white data, the total count for under 21 can be obtained by summing these values.

Let's combine the values:

- Under 21 White: 139,137
- Under 21 Non-White: 137,013
- Under 21 Combined: 139,137 + 137,013 = 276,150

Therefore, the total for under 21 years of age for all classes is 276,150.

To determine the number of newly diagnosed patients, we need to analyze the fields related to patient counts and treatments for each study population. The fields that contain this information seem to be 'L1pop', 'L1pop2', and the corresponding 'most common tretmen' fields.

For L1pop, it states 3000 patients. For L1pop2, there is a checkmark beside it. The majority treatment column doesn't have a number, but the 'most common treatment' column has 47.1 mm Hg.

If we consider that 'newly diagnosed' may refer to the total number of cases, including both L1pop and L1pop2, adding these numbers together:
3000 (L1pop) + 471 (most common treatment/assuming the same number) = 3471.

Therefore, the answer is 3471, which equals 471 because there is a checkmark indicated for L1pop2.

I need to find the number of people under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950. The table shows this information under column "Classes".

The "All Classes" row has the values 139,137 for whites and 136,471 for non-whites.

To subtract the age under 21 from the total population age over 5:

For whites: 15,660 (ages over 5) - 139,137 (ages under 21) = -123,477

For non-whites: 6,551 (ages over 5) - 136,471 (ages under 21) = -129,920

The relevant data for under 21 years of age for all classes in St. Louis County, 1950 is provided in Table A-2. Specifically, it shows that in the Unemp. column, the total population under 21 years of age is 3,950, and the total number of those in the labor force is 3,393. However, the table does not directly provide statistics for Whites and Nonwhites (either all classes combined or separately) under 21 years of age in 1950. The data may not be available in a way that compares these populations across all classes distinctly. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the exact numbers for White and Nonwhite (combined or separately) under 21 years of age under the given table structure.
</think>
<answer>
The information presented in Table A-2 does not clearly segment the populations under 21 years of age into White and Nonwhite categories, and thus, it is not possible to determine the specific age breakdowns for these groups based solely on this data.

< think > The key information needed to identify when Klein was at San Diego State College is within the section that lists his academic institutions and years. The relevant section for this task is the "EDUCATION" section of the resume. Here, it clearly states "San Diego State College" in the "Institution" field and the corresponding "Year" is given as 1956. There is no indication that he was there in 1954 or 1966, which aligns with the year 1956. Therefore, the year Klein's tenure at San Diego State College is 1956.

Content: <think>Let's analyze the biographical section provided:

1. The first entry states, "San Diego State College, B.A., 1956". This indicates when he obtained his bachelor's degree.

2. The "Career Education Experience" section under Professional Activity references "Child Psychology, Head, Division of Human Development".

3. The "RESIDENCE" section notes "Resided in Guatemala".

Based on this information, we can conclude:

- San Diego State College: 1956
- Career in Psychology: 1970-present (as mentioned in Professional Activity)
- Residence in Guatemala prior to and during his 1970 present position

The question specifically asks about the year he attended San Diego State College. We now know the timeframe of his professional activities starts from 1956.

In the given list of tasks, there is a task specifically mentioning "Provide promotional materials." This indicates instructions were directed towards individuals, possibly during the event setup or promotion phase. No mention of hats, particularly promotional hats for company personnel, is included explicitly. None of the tasks relate to the type of hats ordered. 

The closest relevant task might be an invitation list where it explicitly mentions hats: "4. Arrange for display of suitable beef farm equipment along with display of clean, fresh sugarbeets." This suggests perhaps hats were an element of the invitation's description, but they're not directly assigned as a task for "company personnel's" hats, and the list provided does not contain other tasks related to purchasing or distributing promotional hats.

Given this context, the type of question posed is about a detail in the list that isn't directly assigned to the company personnel. Therefore, there may not be another task that specifies to assign hats.
